==============
*Use the Oculus Rift to create true Virtual Reality*

We believe that the Oculus Rift can be used for more than just virtual reality gaming. It can be used to make the next big step in creating Augmented Reality. 

We hooked up two usb cameras to the Oculus Rift and combined the input to get a view with actual depth. We are also using to the OpenCV library in Unity. This will allow us to create a base for many Augmented Reality applications.

Greetings from the developers of Oculus Reality,

**IMPORTANT** *Be sure to follow every step in the description in order to save yourself some unneeded trouble.*

This is a guide to help you set up your project.

**Requirements:**
